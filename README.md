# Exxeta Hackathon Challenge @ Q-Hack 2024

## Hackathon Use Case: Sustainability Companion App

In this hackathon, tech students are challenged to create innovative software solutions for a Sustainability Companion App. The goal is to harness the power of serverless technologies, Kubernetes, and cloud services like Azure or AWS to build scalable, efficient, and impactful applications that contribute to the sustainability of urban environments.

## Target Group

- Students with interests in cloud computing, serverless architectures, and sustainability.
- Students with skills in web/mobile development, backend infrastructure, and DevOps.

## The application we will build â€“ A sustainable transportation companion app:

- Allows users to log and track their daily commutes to university or work, identifying the most sustainable transportation options.
- Calculates carbon footprint savings for choices like walking, biking, carpooling, or using public transit.
- Adds gamification and features a leaderboard and rewards system where users earn points for sustainable travel choices. Encourages friendly competition for individuals, groups of friends, or colleagues.

## Technology Stack

- **Serverless:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions for building scalable, cost-effective, and event-driven applications.
- **Kubernetes:** Container orchestration for managing microservices-based applications.
- **Cloud Services:** AWS or Azure for hosting, storage, databases, IoT, analytics, and machine learning services.
- **Frontend:** Any modern JavaScript framework (React, Angular, Vue.js) or mobile development platform (React Native, Flutter).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python, Go, or any other backend language suitable for serverless and containerized environments.

## Deliverables

- A working prototype of the application (backend, frontend, or mobile app).
- A presentation that includes:
  - Problem statement and solution overview.
  - Architectural diagram showing how serverless, Kubernetes, and cloud services are used.
  - Demonstration of the prototype.
  - Impact assessment on sustainability.
  - Future roadmap and potential scalability of the solution.

## Resources Provided

- Access to cloud service providers (AWS or Azure).
- Documentation and starter templates for serverless and Kubernetes.
- List of APIs and data sources related to urban infrastructure and sustainability.
- IoT devices and sensors if required.
- Mentoring sessions with experts in cloud computing, sustainability, and urban planning.

This hackathon encourages students to think critically about the role of technology in sustainability, pushing them to innovate and develop practical solutions that could make a real-world difference. By focusing on serverless architectures and cloud-native technologies, participants will gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools that are shaping the future of software development.
